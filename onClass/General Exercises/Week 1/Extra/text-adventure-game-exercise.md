# Text-Based Adventure Game Exercise

## Objective
Create a simple text-based adventure game using JavaScript. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of variables, arithmetic operations, logical operators, comparison operators, and assignment operators.

## Game Scenario
You're creating a game where the player is an explorer in a mysterious temple. The player will make choices that affect their score and determine the outcome of their adventure.

## Part 1: Game Setup

### Task
Initialize the necessary variables for the game.

### Requirements
- Create variables for the player's name, score, and health.
- Initialize a variable to store the player's current room.

### Hints
- Use `let` for variables that might change during the game.
- Consider using `const` for any values that won't change.

## Part 2: Player Information

### Task
Create a function to set up the player's information.

### Requirements
- The function should prompt the user for their name.
- It should set the initial score to 0 and health to 100.

### Hints
- Use the `prompt()` function to get user input.
- Remember to use assignment operators to set the initial values.

## Part 3: Game Choices

### Task
Create functions for different choices the player can make.

### Requirements
- Create at least three functions representing different rooms or scenarios.
- Each function should present a choice to the player and update their score or health based on their decision.

### Hints
- Use `if...else` statements to handle different player choices.
- Use arithmetic operators to update the player's score and health.

- [JavaScript if...else Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp)
- [JavaScript Arithmetic](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)

## Part 4: Game Logic

### Task
Create the main game logic function.

### Requirements
- The function should call the player setup function.
- It should then present the first scenario to the player.
- Based on the player's choice, it should call the appropriate scenario function.

### Hints
- Use a series of `if...else` statements to determine which scenario to present next.
- Consider using the logical AND (&&) or OR (||) operators to combine conditions.

## Part 5: End Game

### Task
Create a function to end the game and display the final result.

### Requirements
- The function should display the player's final score and health.
- It should also give a message based on how well the player did.

### Hints
- Use template literals to format the output string nicely.
- Use comparison operators to determine what message to display.

### Resources
- [JavaScript Template Literals](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_templates.asp)

## Bonus Challenges
1. Add an inventory system where players can collect items.
2. Implement a simple combat system using random number generation.
3. Create multiple endings based on the player's final score and health.

## Final Steps
- Test your game thoroughly with different choices.
- Make sure all paths through the game are possible and make sense.
- Add descriptive comments to your code to explain what each part does.

Remember to apply the concepts of variables, arithmetic operations, logical operators, comparison operators, and assignment operators throughout your solution. Have fun creating your adventure!
