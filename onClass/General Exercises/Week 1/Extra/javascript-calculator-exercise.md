# JavaScript Calculator Exercise

## Objective
Create a simple calculator program using JavaScript. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of functions, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and introduce you to some built-in JavaScript math methods.

## Part 1: Basic Arithmetic Functions

### Task
Create functions for basic arithmetic operations.

### Requirements
- Create separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Each function should take two parameters and return the result of the operation.

### Hints
- Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) within these functions.
- Remember to handle division by zero in your division function.

- [JavaScript Arithmetic](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)

## Part 2: Advanced Math Functions

### Task
Create functions for more advanced mathematical operations.

### Requirements
- Create functions for:
  1. Calculating the power of a number
  2. Finding the square root of a number
  3. Calculating the absolute value of a number

### Hints
- Use the Math object for these operations (Math.pow(), Math.sqrt(), Math.abs()).
- Remember to handle invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers for square root).

### Resources
- [JavaScript Math Object](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp)

## Part 3: Operation Selection

### Task
Create a function that selects which operation to perform based on user input.

### Requirements
- The function should take three parameters: two numbers and an operation symbol.
- It should call the appropriate function based on the operation symbol.
- Handle invalid operation symbols with an error message.

### Hints
- Use if...else statements or a switch statement to select the operation.
- Consider using string comparison for the operation symbol.

- [JavaScript Switch Statement](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp)

## Part 4: User Input and Output

### Task
Create functions to handle user input and display results.

### Requirements
- Create a function to prompt the user for two numbers and an operation.
- Create a function to display the result or error message.

### Hints
- Use the prompt() function to get user input.
- Remember to convert string inputs to numbers where necessary.
- Use template literals for formatting the output string.

- [JavaScript Template Literals](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_templates.asp)

## Part 5: Main Calculator Function

### Task
Create the main function that runs the calculator program.

### Requirements
- The function should call the input function to get user input.
- It should then call the operation selection function with the user's input.
- Finally, it should display the result using the output function.

### Hints
- Think about the order in which you need to call these functions.
- Consider how you'll handle and display errors.

### Resources

## Bonus Challenges
1. Add memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC) to your calculator.
2. Implement a simple unit conversion feature (e.g., kilometers to miles).
3. Add a feature to calculate the factorial of a number.

## Final Steps
- Test your calculator with various inputs, including edge cases.
- Ensure all functions work correctly and handle errors gracefully.
- Add comments to your code explaining what each function does.

Remember to apply the concepts of functions, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and the Math object throughout your solution. Enjoy building your calculator!
