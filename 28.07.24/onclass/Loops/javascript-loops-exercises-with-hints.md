# JavaScript Loops Exercises

## 'for' Loop Exercises

1. Write a loop that counts from 10 to 1 (backwards).
   Hint: Start your counter at 10 and decrement it in each iteration.

2. Create a loop that prints only even numbers from 2 to 20.
   Hint: Start at 2 and increment by 2 in each iteration.

3. Make a loop that adds up all numbers from 1 to 10 and prints the sum.
   Hint: Use a variable to keep track of the sum and add each number in the loop.

4. Write a loop that prints the 5 times table (5, 10, 15, ..., 50).
   Hint: Multiply each number in the loop by 5.

5. Create a loop that prints this pattern:
   ```
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****
   ```
   Hint: Use nested loops - one for rows and one for columns.

## 'while' Loop Exercises

1. Write a while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
   Hint: Initialize a counter before the loop and increment it inside.

2. Create a while loop that doubles a number until it's bigger than 100.
   Hint: Start with 1 and multiply by 2 in each iteration.

3. Make a while loop that counts down from 20 to 0.
   Hint: Start with 20 and decrement in each iteration.

4. Write a while loop that keeps asking for a password until the correct one is entered.
   Hint: Use prompt() to get user input and compare it to the correct password.

5. Create a while loop that generates random numbers between 1 and 10 until it gets a 5.
   Hint: Use Math.random() and Math.floor() to generate random integers.

## 'do...while' Loop Exercises

1. Write a do...while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5.
   Hint: Initialize a counter before the loop and increment it inside.

2. Create a do...while loop that asks the user if they want to play again.
   Hint: Use prompt() to get user input and check if it's "yes" or "no".

3. Make a do...while loop that rolls a die (1-6) until it gets a 6.
   Hint: Use Math.random() and Math.floor() to simulate a die roll.

5. Create a do...while loop that asks for names and adds them to a list until the user enters "done".
   Hint: Use prompt() to get names and push them to an array.
