2. What does the AND (&&) operator do?
   Hint: It returns true only if both operands are true.

5. What does the OR (||) operator do?
   Hint: It returns true if at least one operand is true.

8. What does the NOT (!) operator do?
   Hint: It inverts the boolean value of its operand.

11. What is the result of true && true && false?
    Hint: AND requires all operands to be true.

12. What is the result of false || false || true?
    Hint: OR requires at least one operand to be true.

13. What is the order of precedence for logical operators?
    Hint: NOT has the highest precedence, followed by AND, then OR.

14. What is short-circuit evaluation in logical operations?
    Hint: It's when the second operand is not evaluated if the first operand is sufficient to determine the result.

15. In the expression a && b, when is b not evaluated?
    Hint: Think about when the result can be determined by a alone.

16. In the expression a || b, when is b not evaluated?
    Hint: Think about when the result can be determined by a alone.

17. What is the result of 5 > 3 && 2 < 4?
    Hint: Evaluate each comparison first, then apply the AND operator.

18. What is the result of 5 > 7 || 3 < 2?
    Hint: Evaluate each comparison first, then apply the OR operator.
    [Learn more about logical operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp)

19. What is the result of !(5 > 3)?
    Hint: Evaluate the comparison first, then apply the NOT operator.

20. How can you use parentheses to change the order of evaluation in logical expressions?
    Hint: Expressions within parentheses are evaluated first.
