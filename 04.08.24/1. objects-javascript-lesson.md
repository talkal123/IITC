# JavaScript Objects

Imagine you have a backpack with different pockets, and in each pocket, you can store different types of items. An object in programming is like this backpack - it's a special container that can hold multiple items of different types, and each item has its own labeled pocket.

## What are Objects?

Objects help us organize related data and functions:
- Instead of creating separate variables for each property, we can group them together.
- Objects make it easy to work with complex entities: Like a user profile or a product in an online store.
- Objects allow us to represent real-world things in code: We can have properties (data) and methods (functions) that belong to the object.

## Why Do We Use Objects?

1. To structure and organize our data
2. To represent real-world entities in our code
3. To create reusable and modular code
4. To make our code more readable and maintainable

## Syntax

### Basic Object Syntax: Creation

Objects are created using curly braces {}. Properties are defined as key-value pairs.

```javascript
// Creating an empty object
let emptyObject = {};

// Creating an object with properties
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

// Adding a property to an existing object
person.job = "Developer";

console.log(person);
// Output: { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York", job: "Developer" }
```

### Basic Object Syntax: Accessing Properties

Object properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.

```javascript
let car = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2022
};

// Accessing properties with dot notation
console.log(car.make);  // Output: Toyota

// Accessing properties with bracket notation
console.log(car["model"]);  // Output: Corolla

// Using variables with bracket notation
let propertyName = "year";
console.log(car[propertyName]);  // Output: 2022

// Modifying a property
car.year = 2023;
console.log(car.year);  // Output: 2023
```

## How Objects Work in Real-World Programming

1. User Profiles: An object can store a user's basic information.
2. E-commerce: Each product can be an object with properties.
3. Game Development: Characters can be objects with basic properties.
4. Form Handling: Form data can be stored as an object with field names as keys.

```javascript
// User Profile Example
let user = {
  name: "Alice Johnson",
  email: "alice@example.com",
  age: 28,
  isActive: true
};

// E-commerce Product Example
let product = {
  id: "P001",
  name: "Wireless Headphones",
  price: 99.99,
  inStock: true
};

// Game Character Example
let gameCharacter = {
  name: "Hero",
  health: 100,
  level: 1,
  weapon: "sword"
};

// Form Data Example
let formData = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  age: 30
};
```

## Creating Objects

In JavaScript, we can create objects in two ways:
- Using object literals
- Using the Object constructor

## Accessing Object Properties

We can access properties in an object using dot notation or bracket notation.

## Modifying Objects

We can change or add properties in an object.

## Object Methods

Arrays have many built-in methods that make them powerful. Objects can also contain functions, which we call methods.

### Object.keys()

Object.keys() returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.

```javascript
let car = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2022
};

let keys = Object.keys(car);
console.log(keys);
// Output: ["make", "model", "year"]

// Looping through keys
for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
  let key = keys[i];
  console.log(key + ": " + car[key]);
}
// Output:
// make: Toyota
// model: Corolla
// year: 2022
```

### Object.values()

Object.values() returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

let values = Object.values(person);
console.log(values);
// Output: ["Alice", 30, "New York"]

// Looping through values
for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
  console.log(values[i]);
}
// Output:
// Alice
// 30
// New York
```

### Object.entries()

Object.entries() returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs.

```javascript
let fruit = {
  name: "Apple",
  color: "Red",
  sweetness: 8
};

let entries = Object.entries(fruit);
console.log(entries);
// Output: [["name", "Apple"], ["color", "Red"], ["sweetness", 8]]

// Looping through entries
for (let i = 0; i < entries.length; i++) {
  let key = entries[i][0];
  let value = entries[i][1];
  console.log(key + ": " + value);
}
// Output:
// name: Apple
// color: Red
// sweetness: 8
```

## Recap

- Objects are like containers that can hold multiple properties and methods.
- We can create, access, and modify properties in objects.
- Objects can have methods (functions) as properties.
