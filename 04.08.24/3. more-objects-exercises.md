**Hint:** Use a switch statement or object lookup for color combinations.

## Exercise 18: Temperature Converter
1. Create an object called `tempConverter` with properties: celsius (number) and fahrenheit (number).
2. Add methods: `setC(temp)`, `setF(temp)`, `getC()`, and `getF()`.
3. When setting one temperature, automatically calculate and set the other.

**Hint:** Use the formulas: C = (F - 32) * 5/9 and F = C * 9/5 + 32

## Exercise 19: Virtual Pet
1. Create an object called `pet` with properties: name (string), type (string), hunger (number), and happiness (number).
2. Add methods: `feed()`, `play()`, and `getStatus()`.
3. `feed()` should decrease hunger, `play()` should increase happiness, and `getStatus()` should return a string describing the pet's state.

**Hint:** Use template literals for `getStatus()` return value.

## Exercise 20: Quiz
1. Create an object called `quiz` with properties: questions (array of objects) and score (number).
2. Each question object should have: text (string), options (array), and correctAnswer (number - index of correct option).
3. Add methods: `askQuestion(index)` and `checkAnswer(index, answer)`.

**Hint:** Use `console.log()` to display questions and options.

## Exercise 21: Inventory Manager
1. Create an object called `inventory` with properties: items (array of objects) where each item has name (string) and quantity (number).
2. Add methods: `addItem(name, quantity)`, `removeItem(name, quantity)`, and `checkStock(name)`.

**Hint:** Use array `find()` method to locate items.

## Exercise 22: Dice Roller
1. Create an object called `dice` with properties: sides (number) and lastRoll (number).
2. Add a method called `roll()` that generates a random number between 1 and `sides`, sets `lastRoll`, and returns the result.

**Hint:** Use `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`.

## Exercise 23: Word Counter
1. Create an object called `wordCounter` with a property text (string).
2. Add methods: `countWords()`, `countCharacters(includeSpaces)`, and `getFrequentWords()`.
3. HARD: `getFrequentWords()` should return the most frequent words.

**Hint:** Use string methods like `split()` and object to store word frequencies.

## Exercise 24: Simple Calculator
1. Create an object called `calculator` with properties: result (number).
2. Add methods: `add(n)`, `subtract(n)`, `multiply(n)`, `divide(n)`, and `clear()`.
3. Each method (except `clear()`) should update and return `result`.

**Hint:** Use method chaining to allow operations like `calculator.add(5).multiply(2)`.

## Exercise 25: Rock Paper Scissors Game
1. Create an object called `game` with properties: playerScore (number) and computerScore (number).
2. Add methods: `play(playerChoice)`, `getComputerChoice()`, and `determineWinner(player, computer)`.

**Hint:** Use Math.random() for computer choice and nested if statements for winner logic.

## Exercise 26: BMI Calculator
1. Create an object called `bmiCalculator` with properties: weight (number) and height (number).
2. Add methods: `setMetricUnits(weight, height)`, `setImperialUnits(weight, height)`, and `calculate()`.
3. `calculate()` should return the BMI and a description (e.g., "Normal weight", "Overweight").

**Hint:** BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m))^2 or BMI = 703 * weight(lbs) / (height(inches))^2

## Exercise 27: Time Converter
1. Create an object called `timeConverter` with a property seconds (number).
2. Add methods: `setTime(seconds)`, `getHours()`, `getMinutes()`, and `getSeconds()`.
3. Each getter method should return the appropriate part of the time.

**Hint:** Use division and modulo operators.
