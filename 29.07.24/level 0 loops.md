# 30 Basic 'for' Loop Exercises in JavaScript

## Basic Counting Exercises

1. Write a for loop that counts from 1 to 5 and prints each number.
   ```javascript
   // Your code here
   //for ( i = 1 ; i <= 5; i++>)
   //console.log(i);
   ```

2. Create a for loop that counts from 0 to 9 and prints each number.
   ```javascript
   // Your code here
   for ( i = 0 ; i <= 9; i++>)
   console.log(i);

   ```

3. Write a for loop that counts from 10 to 1 (backwards) and prints each number.
   ```javascript
   // Your code here
   for ( i = 10 ; i <= 11; i-->)
   console.log(i);
   ```

4. Create a for loop that counts from 1 to 10, but only prints even numbers.
   ```javascript
   // Your code here
   ```

5. Write a for loop that counts from 1 to 10, but only prints odd numbers.
   ```javascript
   // Your code here
   ```

## Counting with Different Increments

6. Create a for loop that counts from 0 to 15 by 3s (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15).
   ```javascript
   // Your code here
   ```

7. Write a for loop that counts from 1 to 20 by 2s (1, 3, 5, ..., 19).
   ```javascript
   // Your code here
   ```

8. Create a for loop that counts from 2 to 20 by 2s (2, 4, 6, ..., 20).
   ```javascript
   // Your code here
   ```

9. Write a for loop that counts from 10 to 0 by 2s (10, 8, 6, ..., 0).
   ```javascript
   // Your code here
   ```

10. Create a for loop that counts from 5 to 25 by 5s (5, 10, 15, 20, 25).
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

## Printing Patterns

11. Write a for loop that prints "*" five times on the same line.
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

12. Create a for loop that prints "Hello" three times, each on a new line.
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

13. Write a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 3, each followed by "!".
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

14. Create a for loop that prints "A" to "E" (one letter per iteration).
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

15. Write a for loop that prints "2" four times, separated by spaces.
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

## Working with Arrays

16. Given the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, write a for loop to print each element.
    ```javascript
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    // Your code here
    ```

17. Given the array `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`, use a for loop to print each element.
    ```javascript
    let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
    // Your code here
    ```

18. Write a for loop to print each element of `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` backwards.
    ```javascript
    let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    // Your code here
    ```

19. Use a for loop to print every second element of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
    ```javascript
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    // Your code here
    ```

20. Given `['red', 'green', 'blue']`, use a for loop to print "Color: [color]" for each.
    ```javascript
    let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
    // Your code here
    ```

## Simple Calculations in Loops

21. Write a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.
    ```javascript
    let sum = 0;
    // Your code here
    ```

22. Create a for loop to calculate the product of numbers from 1 to 5.
    ```javascript
    let product = 1;
    // Your code here
    ```

23. Use a for loop to count how many even numbers are in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
    ```javascript
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
    let count = 0;
    // Your code here
    ```

24. Write a for loop to find the largest number in `[10, 5, 8, 12, 3]`.
    ```javascript
    let arr = [10, 5, 8, 12, 3];
    let largest = arr[0];
    // Your code here
    ```

25. Use a for loop to calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10.
    ```javascript
    let sum = 0;
    // Your code here
    ```

## Nested Loops

26. Write nested for loops to create this pattern:
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ```
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

27. Create nested for loops to print a 3x3 grid of asterisks.
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

28. Use nested for loops to create this number pattern:
    ```
    1
    12
    123
    ```
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

29. Write nested for loops to create a 4x4 multiplication table.
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

30. Create nested for loops to print this pattern:
    ```
    1
    22
    333
    ```
    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

These exercises focus on reinforcing the basic syntax and usage of 'for' loops in JavaScript. They start with simple counting exercises and gradually introduce more concepts like working with arrays, performing calculations, and using nested loops. Remember to encourage students to experiment with the loop parameters (start, condition, increment) to deepen their understanding.
